* Datomic
- collection of immutable facts
- distributes read, write and query processing across different components
- http://docs.datomic.com/prodmode.png

** Reads
- from storage service
In-process memory
Transactor-local dev/free mode
SQL
DynamoDB
Riak
Couchbase
Infinispan

- facts never change, so they're cached extensively in 'peers' (like your app)
- can read current state, or state in past

** Writes
- go through 'transactor'


** OMG.
'The ability to query and access data locally has a profound effect on the code in a Peer. Query
results are directly accessible as simple data structures. There is no need to deal with the
command and resultset abstractions common to most traditional database APIs, nor the
object-relational mapping layers intended to hide them. A simple group of functions that
encapsulates building and executing queries and transactions is sufficient.

Peer code can use a given database value for an extended period of time without concern. Values
are immutable and provide a stable, consistent view of data for as long as a Peer needs
one. This is a marked difference from relational databases which require work to be done
quickly using a short-lived transaction. The code in a Peer can also access multiple database
values simultaneously, making it possible use different values to process different requests,
and to compare values from different points in time.'
